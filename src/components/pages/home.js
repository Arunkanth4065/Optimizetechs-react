          <p>The optimization techniques are useful in finding the optimum solution or unconstrained maxima or minima of continuous and differentiable functions</p>
          <p>Optimization can be taken to mean minimization since the maximum of a function can be found by seeking the minimum of the negative of the negative of the same function</p>
          <p>There are some well known Optimization Techniques Assignment Problem with Hungarian method and Transportation Problem etc...</p>
          <p>Here we discussed Assignment Problem by Hungarian method and it's models by clicking Assignmet Problem you can access it.....</p>
